# Ethereum Suspicious Activity Identification
 Unveiling the Hidden Depths of Ethereum Transactions: A Machine Learning Approach to Fraud Detection.
 
Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). It has its own native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) that serves as the primary means of payment and settlement on the Ethereum network.

ERC20 is a technical standard for creating and issuing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC20 tokens are fungible, meaning that they are interchangeable and have the same value as one another. Many initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token sales have been launched using the ERC20 standard.

Both Ethereum and ERC20 tokens can be involved in various types of fraud, including:
- Fake ICOs: Scammers may create fraudulent ICOs, offering investors the opportunity to purchase new ERC20 tokens at a discounted price or in exchange for Ether, but then take the investors' money and disappear.
- Pump and dump schemes: Fraudsters may artificially inflate the price of an ERC20 token by promoting it heavily on social media or other channels, then sell their holdings at a profit before the price collapses.
- Token theft: Hackers may steal ERC20 tokens from users' wallets or from exchanges that hold the tokens.
- Smart contract vulnerabilities: Smart contracts on the Ethereum network can be vulnerable to bugs or flaws that allow hackers to exploit them and steal Ether or ERC20 tokens.

The purpose of this study is to perform Ether (ETH) fraud detection and analyze transactional data. By examining the patterns and characteristics of the data, we aim to determine whether or not fraudulent activity has occurred. Through this analysis, we also hope to gain insights into the nature of the transactions and identify any trends or anomalies that may be present. By combining statistical and machine learning techniques, we aim to develop an effective and accurate method for detecting fraudulent transactions and improving overall security in the financial system.
